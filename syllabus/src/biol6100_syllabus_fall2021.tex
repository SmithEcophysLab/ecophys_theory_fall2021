\section{Course Description}
Students in this course will learn mechanistic theory and techniques commonly used in
the field of plant physiology. The course will focus on data acquisition at scales from
the organ to the whole-plant. Theory will be taught through reading of primary literature,
which will be combined with the teaching of techniques in the lab and field.

Please read below if class is to be missed due to an officially approved trip, illness, or special circumstance:

\subsection{Officially Approved Trips}
The person responsible for a student representing the University on officially approved 
trips should notify the instructor of the departure and return schedules in advance.  
The student will not be penalized for the absence but is responsible for the material missed.

\subsection{Illness Based Absence Policy}
If at any time during this semester you feel ill, in the interest of your own health and 
safety as well as the health and safety of your instructors and classmates, you are 
encouraged not to attend face-to-face class meetings or events.  Please review the steps 
outlined below that you should follow to ensure your absence for illness will be excused:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Call Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider.}
	\item{Contact Dr. Smith to let him know of your situation.}
	\item{If appropriate, obtain and return a doctor's note to Dr. Smith.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Special Circumstance Absence}
There may be special circumstances that render missing class unavoidable.
If this arises, please let Dr. Smith know of the situation as soon as possible,
so that the loss of point due to the absence can be discussed.

\section{TTU COVID-19 Policy Reminders}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Although COVID-19 vaccinations are not mandated, Texas Tech is strongly 
	recommending that all students be vaccinated for COVID-19. The vaccines are safe 
	and effective and will protect the student and other members of the Texas Tech community.}
	\item{Masks will not be required for either indoor or outdoor activities on campus, 
	however, all visitors to the Student Health Clinic will be required to wear a mask. 
	The wearing of masks while in public indoor settings and frequently washing your 
	hands has proven to be effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19.}
	\item{The CDC recommends that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals 
	wear a face mask indoors after a known exposure.}
	\item{Prior to arrival on campus, all unvaccinated students in university housing 
	should develop an action plan in the event they are required to self-isolate or 
	quarantine due to a positive COVID- 19 diagnosis or exposure. This plan should 
	include a location to complete the self- isolation/quarantine period, access to 
	groceries/meal delivery, access to necessary medications, numbers of emergency 
	contacts, and contact information for their preferred healthcare provider.}
	\item{Fully vaccinated students (including those with medical or religious exemptions) 
	who aren’t experiencing symptoms will not be required to quarantine following an 
	exposure to a COVID-19 positive person, including roommates. Following a known exposure, 
	students should monitor for symptoms over the course of 14 days and quarantine if symptoms develop.}
	\item{Fully vaccinated students who receive a positive diagnosis for COVID-19 will be required to self-isolate. 
	Students that are vaccinated, including those with medical and religious exemptions, 
	and live in university housing will be provided with a location to complete the self-isolation 
	period. If an off-campus location is necessary, the university will cover the associated housing expenses.}
	\item{Unvaccinated or undisclosed students who have been identified as having a known exposure to
	a COVID-19 positive person will be required to quarantine for a minimum of 7 days or 
	longer depending upon testing. If a student is unvaccinated and can prove a COVID-19 
	diagnosis and recovery in the last three months, quarantine will not be required.}
	\item{Unvaccinated or undisclosed students who receive a positive diagnosis for 
	COVID-19 will be required to self-isolate. The university will offer information 
	regarding off-campus options for unvaccinated students that reside in university 
	housing to complete the self-isolation period but will not cover any associated expenses.}
	\item{Any student who has a laboratory confirmed case of COVID-19 must use this link to report:
	\url{https://ttucovid19.ttu.edu/User/Consent}}
	\item{Students who have a high-risk exposure to someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in
	the last 2 weeks should access the online reporting platform to take a “quick assessment” 
	or “full self-screening.” Based on responses, automated messages provide contact 
	information for campus/clinic resources, emergency room precautions, or planning observation.}
	\item{Students who are fully vaccinated and want to participate in the vaccination 
	incentive opportunity may submit their vaccination record to Student Health Services 
	using the Submit Vaccination Record button at \url{https://www.depts.ttu.edu/communications/emergency/coronavirus/}.}

\section{Special Considerations}
\subsection{Disabling Condition}
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to 
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to 
meet the course requirements should contact Dr. Smith as soon as possible to make 
any necessary arrangements. Students should present appropriate verification from Student 
Disability Services. Please note instructors are not 
allowed to provide classroom accommodations to a student until appropriate verification 
from Student Disability Services has been provided. For additional information, you may 
contact the Student Disability Services office at 335 West Hall or 806-742-2405.

\subsection{Religious Holy Days}
"Religious holy day" means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are 
exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code §11.20.
A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known 
in writing to the instructor prior to the absence. A student who is absent from classes 
for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or 
complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence.
A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor 
may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.

\section{Academic Integrity}
As stated in the Texas Tech University catalog, “The attempt of any students to present 
as their own work that they have not honestly performed is regarded by the faculty and 
administration as a serious offense and renders the offenses liable to serious 
consequences, possibly suspension.” This statement applies to cheating in whatever 
manner, including plagiarism.

\section{TTU Resources for Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Violence}
Texas Tech University is committed to providing and strengthening an educational, 
working, and living environment where students, faculty, staff, and visitors are 
free from gender and/or sex discrimination of any kind. Sexual assault, discrimination,

\section{Online Classroom Civility}
Texas Tech University is a community of faculty, students, and staff sharing an 
expectation of cooperation, professionalism, respect and civility in all forms of 
university communication and business. This expectation applies to all interactions in a 
classroom setting where an exchange of ideas and creative thinking should be encouraged 
and where intellectual growth and development are fostered. As we consider ways in which 
we maintain a productive and cooperative online environment, many of the same standards 
from a face-to-face instruction transfer to the online setting. In this way, at the 
instructor’s discretion, disruptive behavior may result in disciplinary referrals pursuant 
to the Texas Tech University Code of Student Conduct. Students are expected to maintain 
online behaviors that are conducive to learning.

Examples of behavior that may be considered disruptive include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Disrupting the flow of a class session(s) by making off-topic comments.}
	\item{Enabling or participating in online classroom hijacking (“Zoombombing”) by 
	participating in online classroom streams without being enrolled in the course or 
	by sharing streaming classroom links with parties not enrolled in the course.}
	\item{Spamming, hacking, or using TTU or Blackboard platforms for commercial purposes.}
	\item{Cyberbullying or online harassment.}
	\item{Habitually interfering with or stopping instructional delivery}
\end{itemize}
