\section{Course Description}
Students in this course will learn mechanistic theory and techniques commonly used in
the field of plant physiology. The course will focus on data acquisition at scales from
the organ to the whole-plant. Theory will be taught through reading of primary literature,
which will be combined with the teaching of techniques in the lab and field.

\section{Learning Objective}
This course will broadly focus on understanding the theory behind techniques
used in plant physiology, with a focus on those use in plant physiological ecology. 
The course will also use hands-on lessons to teach students how to perform those
techniques.
Class activities will be based on discussion and dissemination of ideas, 
including classic and recent scientific literature. 
Topics will be flexible and modified to match student interests where possible.

\section{Attendance Policy}
Attendance is strongly recommended. 
The course assessments will be done during class (see below).

\section{Course Assessment}
\subsection{\textit{Participation and Engagement}}
Being an active and engaged participant in the class will benefit your understanding
of material as well as your peers'. Examples include asking questions, providing feedback,
and facilitating discussion. Participation and engagement of each student will be monitored
during each class period and will constitute the only assessment.

\section{Grading}
Participation and Engagement: 100\% \par

\section{Grading Scale}
A: $\geq$ 90\% \par
B: 80 – 90\% \par
C: 70 – 80\% \par
D: 60 – 70\% \par
F: $\leq$ 59.9\% \par

\section{Missing In-class Activities}
Students will be required to be in class to receive participation and engagement points. 
Please contact Dr. Smith if you plan to miss class for a university function 
\textit{prior to class}. If class is missed due to an illness, 
please let Dr. Smith know as soon as possible (see COVID illness based absence policy below).

\subsection{Illness Based Absence Policy}
If at any time during this semester you feel ill, in the interest of your own health and 
safety as well as the health and safety of your instructors and classmates, you are 
encouraged not to attend face-to-face class meetings or events.  Please review the steps 
outlined below that you should follow to ensure your absence for illness will be excused. 
These steps also apply to not participating in synchronous online class meetings if you feel 
too ill to do so and missing specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes 
because of illness. If you are ill and think the symptoms might be COVID-19-related:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Call Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider.  
	After hours and on weekends contact TTU COVID-19 Helpline at [TBA].}
	\item{Self-report as soon as possible using the Dean of Students COVID-19 webpage.
	This website has specific directions about how to upload documentation from a medical 
	provider and what will happen if your illness renders you unable to participate in 
	classes for more than one week.}
	\item{If your illness is determined to be COVID-19-related, all remaining 
	documentation and communication will be handled through the Office of the 
	Dean of Students, including notification of your instructors of the period of 
	time you may be absent from and may return to classes.}
	\item{If your illness is determined not to be COVID-19-related, please follow steps below.}
\end{itemize}

If you are ill and can attribute your symptoms to something other than COVID-19:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{If your illness renders you unable to attend face-to-face classes, participate 
	in synchronous online classes, or miss specified assignment due dates in asynchronous 
	online classes, you are encouraged to visit with either Student Health Services at 
	806.743.2848 or your health care provider.  Note that Student Health Services and 
	your own and other health care providers may arrange virtual visits.}
	\item{During the health provider visit, request a “return to school” note;}
	\item{E-mail the instructor a picture of that note;}
	\item{Return to class by the next class period after the date indicated on your note.}
\end{itemize}

\section{TTU COVID-19 Policy Reminders}
The Texas Tech University System has implemented a mandatory Facial Covering Policy to 
ensure a safe and healthy classroom experience. Current research on the COVID-19 virus 
suggests that there is a significant reduction in the potential for transmission of the 
virus from person to person by wearing a mask/facial covering that covers the nose and 
mouth areas. Because of the potential for transmission of the virus, and to be consistent 
with the University’s requirement, students in this class are to wear a mask/facial 
covering before, during, and after class. Observing safe distancing practices within 
the classroom by spacing out and wearing a mask/facial covering will greatly improve 
our odds of having a safe and healthy in-person class experience. Any student choosing 
not to wear a mask/facial covering during class will be directed to leave the class and 
will be responsible to make up any missed class content or work.

\section{Special Considerations}
\subsection{Disabling Condition}
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to 
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to 
meet the course requirements should contact Dr. Smith as soon as possible to make 
any necessary arrangements. Students should present appropriate verification from Student 
Disability Services. Please note instructors are not 
allowed to provide classroom accommodations to a student until appropriate verification 
from Student Disability Services has been provided. For additional information, you may 
contact the Student Disability Services office at 335 West Hall or 806-742-2405.

\subsection{Religious Holy Days}
"Religious holy day" means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are 
exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code §11.20.
A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known 
in writing to the instructor prior to the absence. A student who is absent from classes 
for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or 
complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence.
A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor 
may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.

\section{Academic Integrity}
As stated in the Texas Tech University catalog, “The attempt of any students to present 
as their own work that they have not honestly performed is regarded by the faculty and 
administration as a serious offense and renders the offenses liable to serious 
consequences, possibly suspension.” This statement applies to cheating in whatever 
manner, including plagiarism.

\section{TTU Resources for Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Violence}
Texas Tech University is committed to providing and strengthening an educational, 
working, and living environment where students, faculty, staff, and visitors are 
free from gender and/or sex discrimination of any kind. Sexual assault, discrimination,

\section{Online Classroom Civility}
Texas Tech University is a community of faculty, students, and staff sharing an 
expectation of cooperation, professionalism, respect and civility in all forms of 
university communication and business. This expectation applies to all interactions in a 
classroom setting where an exchange of ideas and creative thinking should be encouraged 
and where intellectual growth and development are fostered. As we consider ways in which 
we maintain a productive and cooperative online environment, many of the same standards 
from a face-to-face instruction transfer to the online setting. In this way, at the 
instructor’s discretion, disruptive behavior may result in disciplinary referrals pursuant 
to the Texas Tech University Code of Student Conduct. Students are expected to maintain 
online behaviors that are conducive to learning.

Examples of behavior that may be considered disruptive include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Disrupting the flow of a class session(s) by making off-topic comments.}
	\item{Enabling or participating in online classroom hijacking (“Zoombombing”) by 
	participating in online classroom streams without being enrolled in the course or 
	by sharing streaming classroom links with parties not enrolled in the course.}
	\item{Spamming, hacking, or using TTU or Blackboard platforms for commercial purposes.}
	\item{Cyberbullying or online harassment.}
	\item{Habitually interfering with or stopping instructional delivery}
\end{itemize}

\section{Creating Livable Futures}
This class is part of a campus-wide initiative called Creating Livable Futures, 
which is sponsored in part by the Texas Tech Center for Global Communication. 
As such, one of our objectives is to prepare you to communicate, 
in a fully interdisciplinary and global way, the challenges posed by pressing issues 
that speak to our collective wellbeing and sustainability. You will be asked to translate 
and communicate the work of leading thinkers on sustainability, and to expand discussing 
those materials through research experience and experiential learning.
These objectives will be met through discussion leads and the review paper. 

Your progress in communicating about global issues will be evaluated according to the 
Center for Global Communication rubric, so you will be invited to participate 
in one or more Creating Livable Futures activities outside of class that will 
complement class content. 
Planned Creating Livable Futures activities include participating in and attending 
speaker events and conferences, edit-a-thons, blogging and publication opportunities, 
student organizations, a book club, and even small scholarship opportunities for research. 

You’ll be informed of relevant opportunities and activities as they arise over 
the course of the semester.
